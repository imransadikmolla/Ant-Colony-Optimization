# Ant-Colony-Optimization

Mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) are collection of distributed nodes which communicate using multi-hop wireless links. 
In order to manage the frequent topology change and ineffective communication, Distributed Spanning Tree (DST) interconnection
technique can be used. DST technique guarantee network connectivity, efficient routing and maintain network performance in MANET. 
In MANET, nodes work for tasks of similar goal (common interest). So, most of the nodes try to access the similar data at different period.
By using Data cache system (DCS), we can improve the efficiency of MANET to some extent . In this paper, Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) 
technique is used to enhance the efficiency of data cache system in MANET at higher level. ACO technique improves the data transfer speed by finding optimal path 
between nodes of MANET in dynamic fashion. Analysis from simulation of our proposed work shows that data cache system efficiency can be improved using DST technique.
